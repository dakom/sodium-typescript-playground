# Sodium-Typescript Playground

This is mostly just a personal repo for trying out some stuff via sodium-typescript. 

There may be purposefully broken code to highlight questions, for example.

That said, you can see the current live demo at [Boilerplate](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/html5-boilerplate)

(note, the boilerplate webpack, typescript, etc. code is cloned from [here](https://github.com/dakom/html5-boilerplate/tree/barebones))
